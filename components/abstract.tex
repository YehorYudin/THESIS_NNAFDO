Design Optimization is a prospective field of engineering approaches which allows to find solutions for many engineering problems under multiple constrains in an emergence manner.
However, the existing algorithms are computationally expensive and could be sped up by finding heuristic coarse results and using them as initial educated guess.
In the work it proposed to use a Artificial Neural Network model trained on data composed of the existing Topology Optimization cases to quickly infer the approximate results based on the initial conditions. The corresponding Convolution Neural Network architecture is proposed and its performance is analyzed
