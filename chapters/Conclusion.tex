\label{chapter:Conclusion}

In this work we presented a Convolution Neural Network model for predicting approximate results of Topology Optimization process.
We proposed an CNN architecture and its implementation in Python using Tensorflow, together with the infrastructure for model  training and optimization, data preparation, pre-processing, post-processing and results evaluation.
