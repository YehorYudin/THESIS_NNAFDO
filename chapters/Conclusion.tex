\label{chapter:Conclusion}

In this work we presented a Convolution Neural Network model for predicting approximate results of Topology Optimization process.
We proposed an CNN architecture and its implementation in Python using Tensorflow, together with the infrastructure for model  training and optimization, data preparation, pre-processing, post-processing and results evaluation.
\medskip

The approach is novel for such approximation and it is a first data-driven model suiting the 3D Topology Optimization simulation.
The method shows good accuracy for predictions of the results of the Topology Optimization process with the inference of a single solution taking significantly less time.
Being a highly sensitive for accuracy, Topology Optimization is able to used the inferred results not as the final ones, but as an educated guess for initial conditions for further simulations. 
The software framework, designed by us, suits well for producing accurate models, that could prepare preliminary data as input for Topology Optimization software in an automated manner.
Using our model we were able to significantly decrease the size of the Finite Element Problem used at every iteration of the Topology Optimization, whir potentially bring a great speedup for such algorithms.
