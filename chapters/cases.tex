The physical problem for which the Topology Optimization (TO) is perfromd is defined by the Boundary Condtions (BC) and the force applied to the element. 
The former has a view of Dirichlet BC and define the parts of the element that experience no displaycement anf the latter is in genral form a filed of forces applied to all the poitn of the element. 
Translated in the deiscetised form used in the Finite Element Analysis (FEA) perfromed during the TO, the former defined the fixed degrees of freedom and the latter defines the non-zero elements of the right-hand-side vector of loads.
