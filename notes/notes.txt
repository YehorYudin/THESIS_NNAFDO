Variables:

	Boundary conditins : used 3 cases
			Wall fixed
			Corner points
			middle third interval deleted
		one of 4 sizes chosen
		
	Volume fraction: used 3 cases 
			0.1 
			0.2
			0.4
		imput as a low-dim channel
		+ penlty on Vf in loss function (calculated on batch size)
		
	Resolution: used 2 cases:
			32 x 32
			16 x 16
			
	Forces location: 1 point of application in right half of the domain

	
---------------------------------------------


figures at data; check 3d results; numbers on 2d (see list) ;

22.06:  test for 3x3 datset (32_0.2 allsdf) -in prog
	maybe		 restrucure methodology ; arch to intro(resnet) ;

25.06:	use TO consistently -in prog ;previous work: another speedup arpoaches + novelty
	add about other architecures ; add about typical problems at outputs -in porg


images: new for convoutions(x4), ? optimization(gradient descent), activation(smaller) , ?regularization(x2), post processing(before and after),
	plot( on size, on number of steps), training loss for datsets, examples of results (good, bad , horrible), single heatmap, example soution + BC&load
	examples for dataset choice(porblems with changin coordinates) 
	3d results: original + BC&load, compare GT and model, compare GT and new
