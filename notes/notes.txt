figures at data; check 3d results; numbers on 2d (see list) ; all image (new colormap)

19.06: arch to intro(resnet) ;
	use TO consistently ; in cnn intro make an ouline an then details ; previous work: another speedup arpoaches + novelty
	restrucure methodology ; add about other architecures ; add about typical problems at outputs
