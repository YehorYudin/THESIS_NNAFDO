Variables:

	Boundary conditins : used 3 cases
			Wall fixed
			Corner points
			middle third interval deleted
		one of 4 sizes chosen
		
	Volume fraction: used 3 cases 
			0.1 
			0.2
			0.4
		imput as a low-dim channel
		+ penlty on Vf in loss function (calculated on batch size)
		
	Resolution: used 2 cases:
			32 x 32
			16 x 16
			
	Forces location: 1 point of application in right half of the domain

figures at data;


		 arch to intro(resnet)

25.06:	use TO consistently -in prog ;previous work: another speedup arpoaches + novelty
	add about other architecures


images: new for convoutions(x4), ? optimization(gradient descent), activation(smaller) , ?regularization(x2), post processing(before and after),
	

genrate images: training loss for datsets, examples of results (good, bad, horrible), single heatmap, example soution + BC&load
	3d results: original + BC&load, compare GT and model, compare GT and new

generate numbers:  time to train for 3d and 2d,
	          ideas iterations for all 3 cases
